# The Goal of the Project üéØ
Let's say FLO aims to launch a top segment, higher quality and higher price product in the new season. Investing in the product to understand whether this product will be sold can lead to uncertainty and financial loss. As Data Scientists, we can speculate whether this product fits our customer segments.

# Project Steps üë©‚Äçüíª
In this project, I made an analysis at a level where I could examine the habits of the customers, taking into account the age, gender and category of the customers, and revealed the customer segment.

I calculated the Recency, Frequency and Monetary metrics specific to the customer and calculated the RF score on these metrics. This way, I looked at the last time customers shopped and how often they shopped in the past. Afterwards, I divided the customers into segments by assigning them to certain names with the result obtained from here.

At the end of the project, I can have a mailing list and I can do marketing by segment.
